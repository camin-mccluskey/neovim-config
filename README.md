# Neovim Config

This is my neovim config. Very much subject to change.

## Installation

Clone this repo into `~/.config/nvim` and run `:PlugInstall` in neovim.

## Plugins


## TODO

- [ ] Move to Lua
- [ ] Move plugin configs to seperate files - inspired by [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=434tljD-5C8&ab_channel=JessArcher)
- [ ] Add better code completion and stop Copilot for stepping on code completion
